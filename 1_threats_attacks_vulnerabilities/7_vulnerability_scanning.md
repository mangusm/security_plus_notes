# **Vulnerability Scanning**

* **Vulnerability Management**
	* Detects, remediates and reports vulnerabilities
	* Maintain system security
	* Comply with corporate policy
	* PCI DSS 
		* Quarterly internal and external vulnerability scans
		* Repeat scans after changes
		* Use approved scanning vendor
		* Remediate and rescan until you achieve a clean report
	* FISMA
		* Conduct vulnerability scans regularly
		* Analyze the results
		* Remediate legitimate vulnerabilities
		* Share information with other agencies
	* Network scans
	* Application scans
	* Web application scans
	* Supplement scans with configuration and log reviews
* **Scan Targets**
	* Develop a list of specific systems and devices you will scan
	* Impact
		* Impact - What is the highest data classification handled by the system?
		* Likelihood - What is the network exposure?
		* Criticality - what impact does the system have on the business?
* **Scan Perspective**
	* Where the scanner exists on the network determines its results
	* Placing the scanner in the DMZ gives the clearest possible picture
	* Placing it on the internet gives an attacker-view of the network
	* Agent-based scanning - Installs software on each target device
	* Credentialed scanning - scanner logs on with credentials to scan the target's configuration
* **SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol)**
	* CVSS - Common Vulnerability Scoring System
	* CCE - Configuration Enumeration
	* CPE - Platform Enumeration
	* CVE - Vulnerabilities and Exposures
	* XCCDF - Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format
	* OVAL - Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language
* **CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)**
	* 10 point scale of 8 different metrics
	* **Exploitability** = AV + AC + PR + UI
		* Attack Vector (AV)
			* Physical (P) - Physical touch/manipulation required
			* Local (L) - Physical or logical console access is required
			* Adjacent Network (A) - Local network access is required
			* Network (N) - Remotely exploitable vulnerability
		* Attack Complexity (AC)
			* High (H) - Requires specialized conditions
			* Low (L) - Easy to exploit
		* Privileges Required (PR)
			* High (H) Requires admin control
			* Low (L) - Requires basic user privileges
			* None (N) - Requires no prior privileges
		* User Interaction (UI)
			* Required (R) - Requires that a user take some action
			*  None (N) - Does not require user interaction
	* **Impact** = C + I + A
		* Confidentiality (C)
			* High (H) - All information is compromised
			* Low (L) - Access to some information is possible
			* None (N) - No confidentiality impact
		* Integrity (I)
			* High (H) - All information is compromised
			* Low (L) - Modification of some information is possible
			* None - (N) No integrity impact
		* Availability (A)
			* High (H) - The system is shut down
			* Low (L) - Performance is degraded
			* None (N) - No availability impact
	* **Scope**
		* Changed (C) - Exploiting the vulnerability can affect other components
		* Unchanged (U) -  Exploiting the vulnerability on affects resources managed by the same security atuhority
* **Analyzing Scan Reports**
	* Severity
	* System Criticality
	* Information Sensitivity
	* Remediation Difficulty
	* System Exposure
	* Before doing anything, validate the vulnerability and that it was properly rated
		* Does the vulnerability match the OS?
		* Is there an existing exception?
* **Correlation Scan Results**
	* Consult industry standards, best practices, and compliance recommendations
	* Compliance means no CVSS scores >= 4.0
