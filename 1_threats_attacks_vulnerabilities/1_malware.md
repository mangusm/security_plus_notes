# **Malware**

* **Viruses, Worms and Trojans**
	* Payload - malicious action taken by the malware
	* Viruses - spread via user interaction (email attachment)
	* Worms - spread on their own, depend on vulnerable systems
	* Trojans - Disguised as legitimate software
		* Best defense is to control which applications a person can install
* **Payloads**
	* Adware - generates ad revenue for the malware author, changes default search engine. Not necessarily dangerous.
	* Spyware - Gathers information without the user's knowledge or consent, and returns it back to the author. Usually comes bundled with legitimate software
		* Keyloggers, searches hard drives, cloud storage
	* Ransomware - Blocks actions until payment is received via encrypting data and holding the key until ransom is paid
	* Cryptomalware - mines currency with stolen compute capacity
* **Backdoors and Logic Bombs**
	* Backdoors - inserted into application by developers for workaround access.
		* Hardcoded passwords, default passwords, unknown access channels

* **Advanced Malware**
	* Rootkits - superuser account that provides unrestricted access to systems.
		* Capable of hiding other programs
		* User mode run with normal priveleges. Easy to write, difficult to detect
		* Kernel mode run with system privileges and are difficult to write but easy to detect
	* Fileless Viruses -   remain in memory and never write themselves to disk
		* Office macros, JavaScript code, windows registry persistence
* **Botnets**
	* Botnets - collections of zombie computers used for malicious purposes
		* Begins by infecting a system and adding it to the botnet
		* Sell/rent the botnet to others to deliver spam/DDoS/mine bitcoin/run brute force
		* C&C network relay orders to the botnet using IRC, twitter or P2P within the botnet.
