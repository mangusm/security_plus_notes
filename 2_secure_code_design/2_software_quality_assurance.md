# Software Quality Assurance

## Code Review
* Most formal process is the Faegan Review:
    * Planning
    * Overview
    * Preparation
    * Meeting
    * Rework
    * Follow-up

## Software Testing
* Model validation - are we building the right software?
* Software verification - are we building the software right?
* Stress testing - simulate real world activity and determine maximum capacity
* User Acceptance Testing (UAT) - Ensures software will work for users
* Regression Testing - Verify that any changes don't have unintneded effects

## Code Security Tests
* Check code for security flaws
* Static Tests
    * use automated techniques to analyze code for errors and security flaws without executing it
* Dynamic tests
    * Execute code to make sure it functions correctly

## Fuzz Testing
* Provides many different input values to the software

## Code Repositories
* Store source files used within development in a central location
* Version control

## Application Control
* whitelist/blacklist certain apps

## Third-Party code
*
